👩‍💻 About Me
Hi! 👋
My name is Maira Rocha, and I am starting my professional journey in Cybersecurity. I am passionate about technology, system logic, and information protection. I am continuously learning and applying concepts related to:
•	Network security (TCP/IP, monitoring, anomaly detection)
•	System administration (Linux)
•	Information security principles (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability – CIA)
•	Basic automation and scripting with Python
•	Practical security analysis
I am seeking internship or junior-level opportunities in cybersecurity, networking, or IT support, where I can contribute to projects while continuing to grow technically and professionally.
