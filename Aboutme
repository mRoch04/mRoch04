🛡️ Professional Statement — Cybersecurity
I am a Cybersecurity undergraduate and Computer Networks Technician with a strong interest in information security, network protection, and system analysis. My motivation for cybersecurity comes from the challenge of understanding how systems work, identifying potential risks, and contributing to the protection of data, networks, and people.
My strengths include analytical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving, which I continue to develop through academic studies, hands-on labs, and personal projects. I have foundational knowledge in network security concepts, Linux system administration, traffic analysis, and basic automation using Python, and I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth in the field.
I value confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, as well as ethical responsibility and adherence to security best practices. I believe cybersecurity plays a critical role in protecting organizations and individuals, and I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute to safer and more reliable digital environments.
I am seeking internship or junior-level opportunities in cybersecurity, networking, or IT support, where I can apply my technical foundation, collaborate with experienced professionals, and further develop my skills while supporting organizational security goals.
